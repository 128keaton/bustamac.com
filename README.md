## Contributing Guidelines:
1. Fork and clone the repo into your GitHub account
2. Navigate to the posts directory.
3. Create a new file, titled `year-month-day-blog-post-title.markdown`
4. Write the post, with the sample template at the very top, edited to your liking.
5. Commit and push the changes, then open a pull request.

## Notes:
We'd prefer most 'posts' written in tip or guide form just because this isn't a news site.
Proper grammer, spelling, and punctuation is a must, and thats why we have pull requests

## Sample Template:
```
